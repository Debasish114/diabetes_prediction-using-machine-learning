The Diabetes prediction dataset is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). The dataset contains 100000 records and 9 dimensions.
The data includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. 
This dataset can be used to build machine learning models to predict diabetes in patients based on their medical history and demographic information. The target variable ”diabetes” is binary (0: non-diabetic,1:diabetic)
